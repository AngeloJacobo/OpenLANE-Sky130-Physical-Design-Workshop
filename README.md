# OpenLANE-Sky130-Physical-Design-Workshop

# MY NOTES
## Day 1:

The core of the chip will contain two type of blocks:
 - Foundry IP Blocks (e.g. ADC, DAC, PLL, and SRAM) = blocks which requires some amount of intelligent techniques to build which can only be designed by foundries.
 - Macro blocks (e.g. RISC-V SOC and SPI) = pure digital logic blocks compared to IP's which might require some analog parts.

Open Source Digital ASIC Design requires three opensourced components:  
- RTL Designs = github.com, librecores.org, opencores.org
- EDA Tools = OpenROAD, OpenLANE,QFlow  
- PDK = Google + Skywater 130nm Production PDK

PDK (Process Design Kit) = A set of data files and documents which serves as the interface between the designer and the fab. Cell libraries, IO libraries, design rules (DRC, LVS, etc.)

### Simplified RTl to GDSII Flow:
- Sythesis = The RTL is converted into a gate level netlist made up of components of standard cell libary. 
- Floor Planning/ Power Planning = Plan silicon area and create robust power distribution network. The power network usually uses the upper metal layer which are thicker than lower layer and thus lower resistance. This lowers the IR drop problem
 - Placement = There are two steps, first is global placement which is the general optimal positons for cells and might not be legal. Next is detailed placement which is the actual legal placements of the cells.
 - Clock tree synthesis = clock distribution to all flip flops and is usually a tree (H-tree, X-tree ... )
 - Routing = Use horizontal and vertical wires to connect cells together. The router uses PDK information (thickness, pitch, width,vias) for each metal layer to do the routing. The Sky130 defines 6 routing layers. It doe global routing and detailed routing.
 - Verification before sign-off = Involves physical verification like DRC and LVS and timing verification. Design Rule Checking or DRC ensures final layout honors all design rules and Layout versus Schematic or LVS ensures final layout matches the gate level netlist from synthesis phase. Timing verification ensures timing constraints are met.  
 The final layout is in GDSII file format.
 
 [OpenLANE](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane) = Opensourced ASIC developemnt flow rerference. It consists of multiple opensourced tools needed for the whole RTL to GDSII flow. This is tuned epecially for Sky130 PDK. It also works for OSU 130nm. It is recommended to read the OpenLANE documentation before going forward.

### Notable details are:  
- The input for the whole flow are the rtl files, sdc file, and PDK files. The output is GDSII/LEF file.
- Yosys is used to convert the HDL to gate level netlist using generic components. The [ABC script](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/) is then used to map the generic components to the standard cell library of the PDK. These ABC scripts is used to make various synthesis strategies (using the Synthesis Exploration) which can optimize the design either with least area or best timing.  

- The OpenROAD application automates Place and Route  

- The Logic Equivalency CHceking (LEC) is used to compare the resulting netlist after optimization of place and route to the gate level netlist from synthesis phase
Antenna Rules Violation = long wire segments will act as antennna and will accumulate charges, this might damage the connected transistor gates. Solution is to eithre use bridging or antenna diode insertion to leak away the charges

```

Inside a specfic design folder contains a `config.tcl` which overrides the default settings on OpenLANE. These configurations are specific to a design (e.g. clock period, clock port, verilog files...). The priority order for the OpenLANE settings:
1. sky130_xxxxx_config.tcl
2. config.tcl
3. Default values

### Task for the Day 1 Lab: Find the flipflop ratio percentage for the design `picorv32a`. This is the ratio of the number of flip flops to the total number of cells

## Steps:
1. Run OpenLANE. Below are the commands used in sequence:
 - `$ docker` = Open the docker platform inside the `openlane/`
 - `% flow.tcl -interactive` = run script for automating the whole RTL to GDSII flow but in step by step `-interactive` mode
 - `% package require openlane 0.9` == retrives all dependecies for running v0.9 of OpenLANE

2. Design Setup Stage.Command used is:
 - `% prep -design picorv32a` = Setup the filesystem where the OpenLANE tools can dump the outputs. This also creates a `run/` folder inside the specific design directory which contains the command log files, results, and the reports dump by each tools. These folders will be empty for now except for lef files generated by this design setup stage. This the merged the cell lef files `.lef` and technology lef files `.tlef` generating `merged.lef` inside `run/tmp/`

3. Run synthesis. Command used is:
 - `% run_synthesis` = Run yosys RTL synthesis, ABC scripts (for technology mapping), and OpenSTA.

### The flipflop ratio is (number of flip flops)/(total number of cells) is 1613/14876 = 0.10843. Or 10.843%

After running synthesis, inside the `runs/[date]/results/synthesis` is `picorv32a_synthesis.v` which is the mapping of the netlist to standard cell library using ABC. The `runs/[date]/reports/synthesis` will contain synthesis statistic reports and static timing analysis reports. The `runs/[date]/synthesis/logs` contains log files for the terminal output dumps for running yosys and OpenSTA.

## Day 2
## Floor Plan General Steps:

#### First step of Physical design flow is to find height and width of core and die.   
Core is where the logic blocks are placed and this seats at the center of the die. The width and height depends on dimensions of each standard cells on the netlist. Utilization factor is (area occupied by netlist)/(total area of the core). In practical scenario, utilization factor is 0.5 to 0.6. This is space occupied by netlist only, the remaining space is for routing and more additional cells. Aspect ratio is (height)/(width) of core, so only aspect ratio of 1 will produce a square core shape.

#### Second step is to define location of Preplaced Cell.   
These are reusable complex logicblocks or modules or IPs or macros that is already implemented (memory, clock-gating cell, mux, comparator...) . The placement on the core is user-defined and must be done before placement and routing (thus preplaced cells). The automated place and route tools will not be able to touch and move these preplaced cells so this must be very well defined

#### Third step is to surround preplaced cells with decoupling capacitors. 
The complex preplaced logicblock requires a high amount of current from the powersource for current switching. But since there is a distance between the main powersource and the logicblock, there will be voltage drop due to the resistance and inductance of the wire. This might cause the voltage at the logicblock to be not within the [noise margin](https://www.electronics-tutorial.net/digital-logic-families/noise-margin/) range anymore (logic is unstable). The solution is to use decoupling capacitors near the logic block, this capacitor will send enough current needed by the logicblock to switch within the noise margin range.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87559347/183011079-5f08eb01-28cf-4617-bcbc-f8f26eacc83d.png)

### Fourth step is Power Planning
Decoupling capactor for sourcing logic blocks with enough current is not feasible to be applied all over the chip but only on the critical elements (preplaced complex logicblocks). Large number of elements switching to logic 0 might cause ground bounce due to large amount of current that needs to be sink at the same time, and switcing to logic 1 might cause voltage droop due to not enough current from the powersource to source needed current of all elements. Ground bounce and voltage droop might cause the voltage to not be within the noise margin range. The solution is to have multiple powersource taps (power mesh) where elements can source current from the nearest VDD and sink current to the nearest VSS tap. This is the reason why most chips have multiple powersource pins.

#### Fifth step is Pin Placement
The input and output ports are placed on the space between the core and the die. The placements of the ports depens on where the cells connected to those ports are placed on the core. The clock port is thicker(least resistance path) than data ports since this clock must be capable to drive the whole chip.

#### Sixt step is Logical Cell Placement Blockage
This makes sure that the automated placement and routing tool does not place any cell on the pin locations of the die.

OPENLANE
Notable details:
Standard cells are not placed on floorplan stage, it is done on Placement stage. Macros or preplaced cells are placed on floorplan stage. Before running floorplan stage, the configuration variables or switches must be configured first. The configuration variables are on `openlane/configuration`:
```
.
├── README.md      
├── checkers.tcl
├── cts.tcl
├── floorplan.tcl  
├── general.tcl
├── lvs.tcl
├── placement.tcl
├── routing.tcl
└── synthesis.tcl 

```
The  `README.md` describes all configuration variables for every stage and the tcl files contain the default OpenLANE settings. All configurations accepted by the current run is on `openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/config.tcl`. This may come either from (with priorirty order):
1. PDK specific configuration inside the design folder
2. `config.tcl` inside the design folder
3. System default settings inside `openlane/configurations`

The `runs/[date]/results/floorplan/picorv32a.floorplan.def` is a design exchange format, containing the die area and positions. 
```
...........
DESIGN picorv32a ;
UNITS DISTANCE MICRONS 1000 ;
DIEAREA ( 0 0 ) ( 660685 671405 ) ;
............
```
The die area here is in database units and 1 micron is equivalent to 1000 database units. Thus (660685/1000)microns\*(671405/1000)microns = 0.443587 micrometer squared. To see actual layout after floorplan, open def file using `magic`

magic -T /home/kunalg123/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def
